# 🚀 Project 5: Space Fleet Commander Explained

Your primary goal is to effectively understand and implement the listed data structures, algorithms, and patterns.

## 🔍 Step 1: Graph & Arrays
Manage star systems and fleet data dynamically.

## 🌐 Step 2: Pathfinding (A*/Dijkstra’s)
Strategically navigate fleets across systems.

## 🚦 Step 3: Observer & Adapter Patterns
Real-time status updates and modular gameplay integration.


## ✅ Project Flow in Short:
- 🔍 Step 1: Graph & Arrays → 🌐 Step 2: Pathfinding (A*/Dijkstra’s) → 🚦 Step 3: Observer & Adapter Patterns

## 🎲 Gameplay Ability System (GAS) Role:
Introduce abilities like **"Warp Jump"**, **"Shield Boost"**.

## Thought Starter:
How does pathfinding shape strategic gameplay?
