Your primary goal is to effectively understand and implement the listed data structures, algorithms, and patterns.

## 🔍 Step 1: Graph & Stack Representation
Store puzzle states and player moves for backtracking.

## 🌐 Step 2: Recursive Backtracking & Binary Search
Solve puzzles effectively and retrieve sorted hints.

## 🚦 Step 3: Template Method & Observer Patterns
Consistent puzzle logic and dynamic UI updates.


## ✅ Project Flow in Short:
- 🔍 Step 1: Graph & Stack Representation → 🌐 Step 2: Recursive Backtracking & Binary Search → 🚦 Step 3: Template Method & Observer Patterns

## 🎲 Gameplay Ability System (GAS) Role:
Introduce abilities like **"Hint Reveal"**, **"Time Freeze"**.

## Thought Starter:
Why is backtracking ideal for puzzle mechanics?
