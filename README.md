# 🎮 UE5 Game Dev Curriculum (Algorithm-First Learning Path)

Welcome to a fully structured, project-based curriculum that teaches **algorithms**, **data structures**, and **software design patterns** through building real games in **Unreal Engine 5**, powered by the **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)**.

This curriculum follows the order of *Grokking Algorithms*, with reinforcement from *Grokking Data Structures* and *Head First Design Patterns*. Each project is gameplay-first, meaning you’ll build actual systems like puzzles, AI behaviors, and combat loops—not just abstract code.

## ✅ Core Project Roadmap (in Learning Order)

Each project builds on what came before, introducing new systems, gameplay logic, and player experience opportunities.

## ✳️ Supplemental Micro-Projects (Optional, Data Structure Focused)

Each micro-project targets a **specific data structure** and implements a focused system that could be plugged into your main games.

| Project Name                             | What You’ll Build                                | Data Structure |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 🧃 [Inventory Organizer](micro_projects/inventory_organizer.md)     | Custom inventory system with undo/redo          | Linked List    |
| 🎯 [Skill Tree Builder](micro_projects/skill_tree_builder.md)       | Unlockable ability system using dependencies     | Tree           |
| 🔠 [Word Suggestion Bot](micro_projects/word_suggestion_bot.md)     | Autocomplete engine using prefix matching        | Trie           |
| 📦 [Crafting System Map](micro_projects/crafting_system_map.md)     | Recipe + material system with multi-mapping      | Set/Multimap   |
| ♻️ [Grid Iterator Demo](micro_projects/grid_iterator_demo.md)       | Custom tile-by-tile traversal systems            | Iterator       |

## 🔍 What’s Inside Each Project File?

Each `.md` file includes:
- 🎮 A clear gameplay **goal**
- 🧠 Step-by-step **system breakdown**
- 🔁 Highlighted **algorithms** and **data structures**
- 🧩 Integrated **design patterns**
- 🎲 A sample **GAS ability** usage
- 💭 A **thought starter** for extending the concept

## 🛠️ How to Use This Curriculum

1. Start at Project 01 and move sequentially.
2. Use the GAS system in UE5 to build out your gameplay logic.
3. Add micro-projects to reinforce any weak areas.
4. Treat each project like a real system in a game you're building.
